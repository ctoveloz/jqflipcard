A little CSS3 animation test I did for a client a few weeks ago. I was just reseaching how animations are done and how they react in different browsers. This code can be executed on any browser, but the flip animation is only shown on CSS3-enabled browsers. On the rest, it just hides one div and shows another.

Demo

Here you can see a little demo of how animations works, using a sample code I took from LaSuricata.com
To make it work just unzip everything to the same folder, open demo.html and click on the Flip Now anchor, and it should "flip".
